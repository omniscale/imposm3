Imposm 3
========

Imposm is an importer for OpenStreetMap data.

Debian installer
================
 
    apt-get install golang git mercurial libleveldb-dev libgeos-dev libgeos++-dev osmosis python-nose python-psycopg2 python-shapely postgis
    mkdir src/github.com/omniscale/ && cd src/github.com/omniscale/ && git clone https://github.com/jmikedupont/imposm3.git
    export GOPATH=`pwd`
    go get github.com/tools/godep
    make


Details
=======
It reads PBF files and
imports the data into PostgreSQL/PostGIS. It can also update the
DB from diff files.

It is designed to create databases that are optimized for rendering (i.e. generating tiles or for WMS services).

Imposm 3 is written in Go and it is a complete rewrite of the previous Python implementation.
Configurations/mappings and cache files are not compatible with Imposm 2, but they share a similar architecture.

The development of Imposm 3 was sponsored by [Omniscale](http://omniscale.com/). There are [commercial licenses available for Imposm](http://omniscale.com/opensource/soss) to support the long-term development of Imposm.
There is also commercial support available from Omniscale.


Features
--------

* High-performance
* Diff support
* Custom database schemas
* Generalized geometries


### In detail


- High performance:
  Parallel from the ground up. It distributes parsing and processing to all available CPU cores.

- Custom database schemas:
  Creates tables for different data types. This allows easier styling and better performance for rendering in WMS or tile services.

- Unify values:
  For example, the boolean values `1`, `on`, `true` and `yes` all become ``TRUE``.

- Filter by tags and values:
  Only import data you are going to render/use.

- Efficient nodes cache:
  It is necessary to store all nodes to build ways and relations. Imposm uses a file-based key-value database to cache this data.

- Generalized tables:
  Automatically creates tables with lower spatial resolutions, perfect for rendering large road networks in low resolutions.

- Limit to polygons:
  Limit imported geometries to polygons from GeoJSON, for city/state/country imports.

- Easy deployment:
  Single binary with only runtime dependencies to common libs (GEOS, ProtoBuf and LevelDB)

- Route relations:
  Import all relation types including routes.

- Support for table namespace (PostgreSQL schema)


Performance
-----------

Imposm 3 is much faster than Imposm 2 and osm2pgsql:

* Makes full use of all available CPU cores
* Bulk inserts into PostgreSQL with `COPY FROM`
* Efficient intermediate cache for reduced IO load during ways and relations building


Some import times from a Hetzner EX 4S server (Intel i7-2600 CPU @ 3.40GHz, 32GB RAM and 2TB software RAID1 (2x2TB 7200rpm SATA disks)) for imports of a 20.5GB planet PBF (2013-06-14) with generalized tables:

* 6:30h in normal-mode
* 13h in diff-mode

osm2pgsql required between 2-8 days in a [similar benchmark (slide 7)](http://www.geofabrik.de/media/2012-09-08-osm2pgsql-performance.pdf) with a smaller planet PBF file (~15GB).

Benchmarks with SSD are TBD.

Import of Europe 11GB PBF with generalized tables:

* 2:20h in normal-mode


Current status
--------------

Imposm 3 is used in production but there is no official 3.0 release yet.

### Planned features ###

There are a few features we like to see in Imposm 3:

* Automatic download and import of differential files
* Support for other projections than EPSG:3857 or EPSG:4326
* Improved integration with tile servers (expiration of updated tiles)
* Custom field/filter functions
* Official releases with binaries for more platforms

There is no roadmap however, as the implementation of these features largely depends on external funding. There are [commercial licenses available for Imposm](http://omniscale.com/opensource/soss) if you like to help with this development.

Installation
------------

### Binary

There are no official releases, but you find development builds at <http://imposm.org/static/rel/>.
These builds are for x86 64bit Linux and require *no* further dependencies. Download, untar and start `imposm3`.

### Source

There are some dependencies:

#### Compiler

You need [Go >=1.5](http://golang.org).

#### C/C++ libraries

Other dependencies are [libleveldb][], [libgeos][] and [protobuf][].
Imposm 3 was tested with recent versions of these libraries, but you might succeed with older versions.
GEOS >=3.2 is recommended, since it became much more robust when handling invalid geometries.
For best performance use [HyperLevelDB][libhyperleveldb] as an in-place replacement for libleveldb.


[libleveldb]: https://code.google.com/p/leveldb/
[libhyperleveldb]: https://github.com/rescrv/HyperLevelDB
[libgeos]: http://trac.osgeo.org/geos/
[protobuf]: https://code.google.com/p/protobuf/

#### Go libraries

Imposm3 uses the following Go libraries.

- <https://github.com/jmhodges/levigo>
- <https://github.com/golang/protobuf/proto>
- <https://github.com/lib/pq>
- <https://gopkg.in/yaml.v2>

These libraries are already vendorized (i.e. the source code is included in the Imposm repository).

#### Compile

Create a [Go workspace](http://golang.org/doc/code.html) by creating the `GOPATH` directory for all your Go code, if you don't have one already:

    mkdir -p go
    cd go
    export GOPATH=`pwd`

Then you need to enable GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT, if you are using Go 1.5. You can skip this if you are using 1.6 or higher:

    export GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT=1

Get the code and install Imposm 3:

    go get github.com/omniscale/imposm3
    go install github.com/omniscale/imposm3

Done. You should now have an imposm3 binary in `$GOPATH/bin`.

Go compiles to static binaries and so Imposm 3 has no runtime dependencies to Go.
Just copy the `imposm3` binary to your server for deployment. The C/C++ libraries listed above are still required though.

See `packaging.sh` for instruction on how to build binary packages for Linux.

Usage
-----

`imposm3` has multiple subcommands. Use `imposm3 import` for basic imports.

For a simple import:

    imposm3 import -connection postgis://user:password@host/database \
        -mapping mapping.json -read /path/to/osm.pbf -write

You need a JSON file with the target database mapping. See `example-mapping.json` to get an idea what is possible with the mapping.

Imposm creates all new tables inside the `import` table schema. So you'll have `import.osm_roads` etc. You can change the tables to the `public` schema:

    imposm3 import -connection postgis://user:passwd@host/database \
        -mapping mapping.json -deployproduction


You can write some options into a JSON configuration file:

    {
        "cachedir": "/var/local/imposm3",
        "mapping": "mapping.json",
        "connection": "postgis://user:password@localhost:port/database"
    }

To use that config:

    imposm3 import -config config.json [args...]

For more options see:

    imposm3 import -help


Note: TLS/SSL support is disabled by default due to the lack of renegotiation support in Go's TLS implementation. You can re-enable encryption by setting the `PGSSLMODE` environment variable or the `sslmode` connection option to `require` or `verify-full`, eg: `-connect postgis://host/dbname?sslmode=require`. You will need to disable renegotiation support on your server to prevent connection errors on larger imports. You can do this by setting `ssl_renegotiation_limit` to 0 in your PostgreSQL server configuration.

### Test ###

#### Unit tests ####

To run all unit tests:

    make test-unit


#### System tests ####

There are system test that import and update OSM data and verify the database content.
You need `osmosis` to create the test PBF files.
There is a Makefile that creates all test files if necessary and then runs the test itself.

    make test

Call `make test-system` to skip the unit tests.

WARNING: It uses your local PostgeSQL database (`imposm3testimport`, `imposm3testproduction` and `imposm3testbackup` schema). Change the database with the standard `PGDATABASE`, `PGHOST`, etc. environment variables.
